Global Alliance DWG Reference Variation Task Team
=================================================

The [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](http://genomicsandhealth.org/) is an international coalition, formed to enable the sharing of genomic and clinical data.
The [Data Working Group](http://genomicsandhealth.org/files/public/Priorities%20-%20without%20membership%20DWG_0.pdf) concentrates on data representation, storage, and analysis, including working with platform development partners and industry leaders to develop standards that will facilitate interoperability.
The [Reference Variation Task Team](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dwgreadtaskteam) is focused on standards for storing and accessing reference genome and variant data -- the results of analysis of primary data collected from sequencing machines.

The team will deliver:
  1. Data model. An abstract, mathematically complete and precise model of the data that is manipulated by the API.
  2. API Specification. A human-readable document introducing and defining the API, accompanied by a formal specification.
  3. Reference Implementation. Open source working code demonstrating the API, ideally which can underpin real world working implementations.
