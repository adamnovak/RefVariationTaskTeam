    // The schemas here describe reference structures and reference hierarchies.
    
    // A reference structure is a graph-based representation of a reference
    // genome and a set of common sequence and structural variants. Such a
    // structure consists of a series of "Blocks" of linear DNA sequence. Each
    // block has two ends, a left (or 5') and a right (or 3'). Links called
    // "Adjacencies" connect these ends together. The presence of an adjacency
    // means that, in at least some people's genomes, the connected blocks of
    // sequence come one after the other, in the order and orientation defined
    // by the ends that are connected.
    
    // The schema represents Blocks and Adjacencies as edges in a graph. The
    // vertices of this graph are unique (but not necessarily permanent) 64-bit
    // integer (Long) IDs, which serve only as meeting points for edges, and the
    // edges are represented by Edge objects, which may belong to either Blocks
    // or Adjacencies. An Edge is directed; it has a left and a right endpoint.
    // In addition to the IDs of its two endpoints, each Edge has its own
    // unique 64-bit integer ID to support annotation of the graph.
    
    // TODO: What if we have to break up a Block? What happens to annotations?
    
    // Every DNA base in a block (called a Position, but not represented as a
    // first-class object in this schema) has a unique, permanent 64-bit integer
    // identifier. Each Block stores the identifier of the first base in it and
    // the total length, and all the bases in a block must have sequential
    // identifiers. Blocks also store the sequence string for the bases they
    // represent, when read along the forward strand from left to right.
    
    // The schema defines "Sides", which serve as references to specific "Faces"
    // (left or right) of uniquely identified bases within blocks. A Side refers
    // to a certain base in a certain orientation. The LEFT Face is used to
    // identify the base in its forward orientation on the forward strand, while
    // the RIGHT Face is used to identify the base in its reverse orientation
    // (on the reverse strand). Sides are mostly used by the API to report
    // mapping results; they aren't necessary in the reference structure itself.
    
    // This schema also defines Generalizations, which are used to describe how
    // the bases in one reference structure can be merged to produce another
    // reference structure at a higher level in a reference hierarchy. Each
    // Generalization says that each base in a certain contiguous block of bases
    // on the lower level (starting at the specified Position and continuing
    // from left to right for the specified length) is merged into the
    // corresponding base on the higher level, starting at the specified
    // Position and continuing forward along the specified strand. If the
    // specified strand is the reverse strand (i.e. Face RIGHT), corresponding
    // Positions are merged in in a backwards relative orientation; otherwise
    // they are merged in in a forwards relative orientation.
